## Project Info
You and your team have been contacted by a local, elusive, client. 
They have a new offering and they need a responsive website built for them in order to market it online; they know you’ve got just the right skill set to craft their vision into reality. 
Secretive as they are, they have decided to NOT give you details about their company, nor give you details on the offering they are marketing. 
Instead, they hand over to you a simple sentence, which they want you to interpret, in order to build the best possible responsive website for them to use as a marketing tool. 
The sentence they give you is:
> “Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus”
